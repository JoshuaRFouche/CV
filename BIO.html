    <h1>A little bit more about me</h1>
    <h4>Born and raised in South Africa.<br>
      became a DJ at the age of 17 and started producing music strongly,at the age of 19</h4>
    <h4>played my first set at a Event called Jungle fevah at 4:20 in the afternoon.<br>
      this is where my first major mistake happened i arrived late and to discover,<br>
      that my usb's where buggered and had set up this whole tracklist,<br>
      i learnt from that moment that i didnt need to do any prep but rather played best when i wing it.</h4>
    <h4>shortly after that i played my first Influence Drum and bass party,
      which was a dream come true i got book according to my style which was great because i got to play what i wanted,
      this is where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xJn6yTQ2Go">Crusty</a> took me under his wing,
      and put me on the influence crew as an artist, It was from hear where my music really started gaining traction,
      now im know as one of the top DNB Djs and producer in South Africa.</h4>
